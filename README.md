# StockChimp

This was my first ever solo full-stack project. Principles I learned included MVC, conditional logic, data manipulation & data persistence (CRUD) - & more. 

I used Ruby, Sinatra and PostgreSQL to create a fully functional web app.

StockChimp takes inspiration from my previous experience of SaaS products & inventory management tools. 

I went for a clean UI with simple, familiar functionality for an app which has a simple purpose: to help a "parts & spares" eCommerce vendor who keeps high volumes of items in their warehouse, giving them an easy web-based way to keep track of their stock. 

In the future, I may recreate this app with fully built-out features or in a different stack but for this Github repo, I've chosen to leave it as it was back at the very beginning of my journey as a developer.
