# StockChimp

StockChimp takes inspiration from my previous experience of SaaS products & inventory management tools. 

I went for a clean UI with simple, familiar functionality for an app which has a simple purpose: for a "parts & spares" eCommerce vendor to keep track of their warehouse stock. 

This was my first solo full-stack project, which helped me to cement a number of fundamental principles including MVC, conditional logic, data manipulation &amp; data persistence. Stack used: Ruby, Sinatra and PostgreSQL.

In the future, I may recreate this app with fully built-out features or in a different stack but for this Github repo, I've chosen to leave it as it was at the beginning of my journey as a developer.
